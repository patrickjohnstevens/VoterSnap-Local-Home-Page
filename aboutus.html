      <h3 id="Team-Member-Name">The Start</h3>
      <p id="Team-Member-About">If we haven't met yet, my name is Patrick John Stevens. I remember stepping into the ballot box of the 2012 general election knowing exactly which candidate I would choose for president... but past that it was really difficult to make any decisions.
You see, in a few cases I'd recognized names of senators, house representatives or legislators, but didn't know anything about their background, stance on various topics, or even the responsibilities of the position at stake. This approach caused me to vote based on the party line (that is, when a party was actually listed next to the candidate name!) because I didn't have anything else to go on. I even gave a failed attempt at Googling some candidate's names for a hurried decision.
<br><br>
I was so frustrated! I found myself voting based on pointless reasons like, 'Oh, this guy has the same first name as me and a cool last name. OK!' Then later I would learn more about both candidates in that situation and wish I had made a completely different choice, At first I blamed myself for not knowing enough and not doing enough research, but doing that kind of research is really labor-intensive for most people.
<br><br>
In January of 2014 I made the decision to make VoteSnap a reality. We launched a prototype in the primaries of 2014 and had our official pilot launch in the general election a few months later. We learned a lot through our wins and our loses to have a much more successful campaign for two local elections in Q1 of 2015.

     <h3 id="Team-Member-Name">The Wins</h3>
      <p id="Team-Member-About">Here at VoterSnap we love #WINS! Who doesn't love to win right?!? The beautiful thing is our philosophy is that we don't win unless we help others win first. Our focus, our attention, and our passion is to serve and provide voters, candidates, and election workers with the tools to effectivly work towards their election goals.
      <br><br>
      One of my favorite evenings of this journey was Get Started Omaha. We were selected as one of five Omaha companies to pitch at the #GetStartedOmaha Inc./Cox Pitch Competition. We were blessed and awarded 2nd place. The biggest win of that night was a great conversation with one of the judges. She gave us tremendous insite into how we are going to fulfill the world-wide vision for VoterSnap. Don't let falling down rob you of you opportunities waiting for you as soon as you get back up. 
      <br><br>The next big #WIN we are working towards is partnering with a handful of institutions to utilize the VoterSnap platform to more effectivly accomplish their goals.

     <h3 id="Team-Member-Name">The Future</h3>
      <p id="Team-Member-About">The vision we have for VoterSnap is crazy-AWESOME! The adventure and journey has not gone as planned but the destination hasn't waivored. In elections all over the world, we see an increased voter turn out, we see people voting with confidence, we see more citizen engagement, and we see different voting systems being utilized than majority vote.
      <br><br> 
      We see a level candiate playing field with a political enviorment where winning the fundraising battle isn't the main variable to win an election, and we see affordable campaign tools that make running and winning an election achievable regardless of how much money you are able to raise.
      <br><br>
      We see a world-class mobile voting system, we see a beautiful, intuitive, and highly trusted election experience, and we see governments, schools, and businesses around the world utilizing VoterSnap as key part of their elections. 
      <br><br>
      Can you see it too?!? Join us on the adventure!
